I built a matrix m[33..126,33..126] where m[i,j] = amount of letters with ASCII
code j in a rule, beginning with a letter with ASCII code i.

For example , if I had only 3 letters (A,B,C) and rules
A->ABC
B->BAAC
C->CB
then I would get matrix:
	1 1 1
	2 1 1
	0 1 1

In each query I have a Word, a Letter and Number (of iterations). I evaluate
matr = m^Number in O(log Number) time, then I have matr[i,j] =
amount of letters with ASCII code j that will be generated if I would begin
with letter ASCII i.

For example, input query is: ABC A 3
matr = m^3 =
	 9  9  9
	12 12 12
	 6  6  6

Input string is ABC, Letter is A. So the answer is:
matr[1,1] + matr[2,1] + matr[3,1] = 27.
